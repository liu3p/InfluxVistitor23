# InfluxVistitor23
This project is all based on InfluxDBWorkbench(https://github.com/JorgeMaker/InfluxDBWorkBench).
Because the influx changed so fase, it's not easy to find a tool. 
This tool is changed for influxdb version 2.3. For the version 1.x , it can not be used. And for 
other version, it's should be changed by yourself.
